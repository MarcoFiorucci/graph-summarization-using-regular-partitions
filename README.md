# graph-summarization-using-regular-partitions

This repository contains a Python 3.6 implementation of a Graph Summariation framework based on Szemer√©di's Regulairty Lemma for the task of separating structure from noise in large graphs, as described in:

Marco Fiorucci, Francesco Pelosin and Marcello Pelillo. Separating Structure from Noise in Large Graphs Using the Regularity Lemma. *Pattern Recognition (under review, 2019)*



## Installation

The packages required are in the file `requirements.txt`

We suggest to create a `virtualenv` and install the packages by just running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To replicate the experiments in the paper just run `sh experiment.sh` if you are in a Windows system you can just sequentially run the commands specified in the latter file.
