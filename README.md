# scalable-graph-search

This repository contains a Python 3.6 implementation of a graph summariation framework based on Szeme√©di's Regulairty Lemma described in:

*"Fiorucci, M., Pelosin, F., & Pelillo, M. Graph Summarization Using Regular Partitions and Its Applications in Pattern Recognition. Submitted to Pattern Recognition"*


## Installation

The packages required are in the file `requirements.txt`

We suggest to create a `virtualenv` and install the packages by just running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To replicate the experiments in the paper just run `sh experiment.sh` if you are in a Windows system you can just sequentially run the commands specified in the latter file.
