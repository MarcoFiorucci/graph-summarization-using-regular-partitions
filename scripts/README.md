# scalable-graph-search

This repository contains a Python 3.6 implementation of the framework described in:

*"Fiorucci, M., Pelosin, F., & Pelillo, M. (2018). Scalable Graph Search Using the Regularity Lemma"*

If you use the code, please cite the above paper.


## Installation

The packages required are in the file `requirements.txt`

We suggest to create a `virtualenv` and install the packages by just running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To replicate the experiments in the paper just run `sh experiment.sh` if you are in a Windows system you can just sequentially run the commands specified in the latter file.
